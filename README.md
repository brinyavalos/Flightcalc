# Flightcalc
The program calculates and displays the estimated flight time between two cities chosen. This occurs by allowing the user to choose a 
departure city and a destination city, using the Haversine formula to compute the distance between the two cities based on their latitude and longitude, 
and estimating the flight time by dividing the calculated distance by the average airspeed of an airplane.
